# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This program uses Google's teachable machine visual learning model to create a rock, paper, scissors game where the player uses their webcam to play against the computer.

I used Google's Teachable Machine to create a model to determine whether the user is displaying rock, paper or scissors. The counter-part of the game where the computer chooses which one to throw out was written in python, I created a list with the three options and then used the random module to choose an option everytime the game is played.
